            <p>Our wide range of services in this area include:</p>

            <h3>Fabric Recovering</h3>
            <p>When your piece of furniture has a strong frame, is comfortable and simply needs new fabric.</p>

            <h3>Reupholstery</h3>
            <p>When your furniture also needs some work on the inside – to refresh or replace lacing, springs,
                webbing or cushions for example.</p>

            <h3>Loose Covers and Cushions</h3>
            <p>A solution for items of furniture which are used very frequently – loose covers and cushion covers
                can be removed easily for cleaning.</p>


            <h2 class="banner">Upholstered Walling</h2>
            <p>This is a luxurious technique of fitting fabric to a wall or wall panels. It is especially effective
                in large rooms such as board rooms and dining rooms, as in addition to the sumptuous look and
                texture of the walling, the fabric helps in insulating and dampening sound.
                Several techniques are used and different options are available.</p>

            <h2 class="banner">Repair and Restoration</h2>
            <p>We are experienced in all areas of restoration and conservation of furniture: from repairing weak or
                damaged frames, to restoring broken or chipped decorative carvings.
